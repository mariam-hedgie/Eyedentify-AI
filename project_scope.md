# 📝 Project Scope – Eyedentify-AI



## 🎯 Project Goal

Eyedentify-AI is a computer vision-based tool designed to assist ophthalmologists in detecting and tracking visible ocular symptoms, starting with conjunctivitis. The project aims to improve remote triage and follow-up by enabling both doctors and patients to capture images of the eye, analyze them using AI, and make informed decisions based on standardized visual assessments.



## 👥 Target Users
	•	Primary: Ophthalmologists seeking to document and monitor visual symptoms across time, especially in remote or follow-up settings.
	•	Secondary: Patients capturing eye symptoms at home with the aid of a guided interface, receiving AI-generated educational feedback.



## 🧩 Core Features (MVP Focus)
	•	Image capture via webcam or upload (clinic or mobile)
	•	Binary classification: Conjunctivitis vs. Normal
	•	Model confidence score (e.g., 87%)
	•	Grad-CAM heatmap overlay for interpretability
	•	Timestamped image tracking and comparison
	•	Simple, rule-based AI suggestion: “Monitor at home” / “Follow up recommended”

## 🌱 Future Features (Post-MVP Vision)
	•	Multi-class classification for more eye conditions (e.g., hemorrhage, ptosis)
	•	Patient symptom timeline visualization
	•	Real-time blink analysis (OpenCV + video)
	•	Educational modules per output
	•	PDF report generation for clinicians
